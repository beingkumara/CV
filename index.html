                    In a village called Kathuria and Rajkanya, a man named Sujan lived with his wife. Sujan's wife was very quarrelsome and angry. He loved his wife very much but his wife could not see him at all. He was fed less and was always disturbed. One day Sujan realized
                    that he could no longer carry on with his wife. So one day he decided in his mind that he would commit suicide. But he does not have the money to buy the rope he needs to commit suicide.
